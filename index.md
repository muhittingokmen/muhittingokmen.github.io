I am an academician at MEF University with research interest in Computer Vision, Image Processing and Machine Learning. For years, I've been trying hard to maximize my productivity in three different directions: scientific research, teaching and  technology development. This site summarizes my work in these directions. Beside my professional work, I am interested in watching movies, reading poems (Nazım Hikmet's my favorite poet), and outdoor sports specially jogging and swimming.       


*To live! Like a tree, alone and free,  
and like a forest, in brotherhood -  
    this longing is ours.*

*-- Nazim Hikmet*
