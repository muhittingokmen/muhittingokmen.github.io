I am an academic at MEF University with research interests in Computer Vision, Image Processing and Machine Learning. For years, I've been trying hard to maximize my productivity in three different directions: scientific research, teaching and technology development. This site summarizes my work in these directions. Beside my professional work, I am interested in watching movies, reading poems (Nazım Hikmet is my favorite poet), and outdoor sports - especially jogging and swimming.       


*To live! Like a tree, alone and free,  
and like a forest, in brotherhood -  
    this longing is ours.*

*-- Nazım Hikmet*
